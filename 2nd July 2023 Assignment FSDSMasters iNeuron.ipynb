    "\n",
    "Modularity: Inheritance enhances the modular design of software systems. It allows classes to be structured in a \n",
    "hierarchical manner, where each class represents a specific level of abstraction. This modular structure makes the\n",
    "codebase easier to understand, maintain, and update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Inheritance is closely related to the concept of polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes\n",

    "In object-oriented programming, both single inheritance and multiple inheritance are mechanisms that allow a class to \n",
    "inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. However, they differ in the number of superclasses a subclass can \n",
    "inherit from.\n",
    " \n",
    "1.Single Inheritance: Single inheritance is a concept where a subclass can inherit from only one superclass. This means \n",
    "that a subclass can have one direct parent class, and it inherits the properties and behaviors defined in that superclass.\n",
    "The superclass can, in turn, have its own superclass, creating a single linear hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance simplifies the class hierarchy by enforcing a clear and straightforward relationship \n",
    "between classes. It avoids complexities that can arise from multiple superclasses with potential conflicts or ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of maintenance: With a linear class hierarchy, it is generally easier to understand, maintain, and debug the codebase. \n",
    "Changes made to the superclass are localized and have a limited impact on the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Multiple Inheritance: Multiple inheritance allows a subclass to inherit from multiple superclasses, enabling it to\n",
    "acquire properties and behaviors from multiple sources. This means that a subclass can have multiple direct parent classes, \n",
    "and it inherits the characteristics defined in all of those superclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code reuse and flexibility: Multiple inheritance enables greater code reuse by inheriting functionality from multiple \n",
    "superclasses. This promotes modular design and allows the subclass to combine features from different sources, making \n",
    "it more flexible and adaptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressive power: Multiple inheritance can model complex relationships and scenarios more accurately. It allows the \n",
    "creation of classes that combine traits and behaviors from various parent classes, providing a richer and more expressive \n",
    "representation of real-world objects or concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, multiple inheritance also brings certain challenges and concerns:\n",
    " \n",
    "Name clashes: If multiple superclasses define methods or attributes with the same name, conflicts may arise. This can \n",
    "result in ambiguity, and the programmer needs to handle these conflicts explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased complexity: With multiple superclasses, the class hierarchy becomes more intricate, which can make the code\n",
    "harder to understand and maintain. It may require careful consideration and design decisions to avoid confusion and \n",
    "potential pitfalls.\n",
    " \n",
    "Diamond problem: The diamond problem occurs when a subclass inherits from two superclasses, both of which inherit from a \n",
    "common superclass. This can lead to ambiguity in method resolution, as the subclass does not know which superclass's \n",
    "method to use. Programming languages handle this problem differently, providing mechanisms like method overriding or \n",
    "virtual inheritance to resolve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while single and multiple inheritance have their differences and advantages, some programming \n",
    "languages support only single inheritance (e.g., Java), while others allow multiple inheritance (e.g., C++). \n",
    "Some languages provide alternative mechanisms, like interfaces or mixins, to achieve similar goals without the \n",

    "in the context of inheritance, and it differs from the \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers in the following ways:\n",
    " \n",
    "1.Private Access Modifier: The \"private\" access modifier restricts the visibility of a member to only the class in which\n",
    "it is defined. It prevents access to the member from any other class, including derived classes. Private members are \n",
    "encapsulated within the class, and they cannot be inherited or accessed directly by subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Protected Access Modifier: The \"protected\" access modifier allows the visibility of a member within the class in \n",
    "which it is defined, as well as in its derived classes. Protected members are accessible by the class itself and any \n",
    "subclasses that inherit from it. This means that protected members can be inherited, accessed, and utilized by derived \n",
    "classes, but they remain hidden from other classes outside the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance and Code Reuse: Protected members enable code reuse by allowing derived classes to access and utilize the \n",
    "inherited members. This promotes the reuse of common functionality defined in the base class within its derived classes, \n",
    "enhancing code modularity and reducing duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation and Controlled Access: By using the \"protected\" modifier, a class can expose certain members to its derived \n",
    "classes while still encapsulating them from external classes. This helps in maintaining the integrity of the class's \n",
    "internal implementation, as the protected members are hidden from unrelated classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Public Access Modifier: The \"public\" access modifier provides the widest visibility for members. Public members are \n",
    "accessible from any class, including derived classes, as well as from code outside the class hierarchy. Public members \n",
    "are not limited to inheritance and can be accessed directly by any other class.\n",
